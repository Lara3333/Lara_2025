# Sprint 2 Checklist

| **Assignment**             | **Points**    | **Grade** |
|----------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| JSON Object & Arrays       | 1             |     0.9      | 

JSON Object: A JSON Object is a way to store and organise data. They use Key and value pairs for this, a little different from arrays, which are structured differently. Ex For JSON Object:<img width="332" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 22 52 37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e53905ee-d5ea-4fb0-b72d-8907cf36954f">

| Input and Output           | 1             |      0.90     |

 Input: Information or data you give to a computer or program,Output: The result or information that the computer or program gives back to you. Example for this: In our RPG we can press 'w' (input) to make the turtle move up (output). This means: Pressing key (input) ----> movement (output)

| Data Types                 | 1             |    .90      |

Here are some examples for Data types: Numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, BigInt, Symbols. And SURPRISE they are different types of data. Her is an example for booleans: <img width="129" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 23 10 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/055e2348-547e-46e8-8d5d-179db825b408">

| Square and Red Squares     | 2             |    .90     |

| For Loops using Sprites    | 1             | .9         |

i gave myself a 0.9 because I did the hacks and on the first one I also changed the colour of the text.

(Btw in case you're wondering why I didn't screenshot my analytics, it's because it says I only have 4 commits and I am 100% sure that is not the case|
| Advocacy                   | 1             |   0.9  |   I always try to engage in the task and participate as well as possible.           |
| Beyond Perfunctory Memory  | 1             |      .85     |   I always, try to think further and connect some dots when learning new things,  however I could definitely still improve there, which is why I gave myself a solid grade.          |
