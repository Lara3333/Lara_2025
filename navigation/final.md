| Total                      | 10             | 8.75          | I think this is an accurate grade for my work. I would however, give myself the 10nth point because I meet several requirements for it. Perhaps, not the full 10nth point but definetely some extra points for the following reasons. (Check the checklist below)              |

However, there is still room for improvement, which is why I gave myself a .9 instead of a 1            |

## Overall score I think I should get

Overall, I would say I deserve an 9.05 - 9.75, because I gave myself a 8.75 on the overall criteria plus, whatever you think I deserve for the 10nth extra credit point.
