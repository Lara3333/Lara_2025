Welcome to my Ideas Page ^^

Throughout my life, I've played a lot of video games. Here are some of the games I've played, my opinion on them and some ideas for future projects:

- Super Mario Odyssey (good)
- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (How to start a war with your family)
- Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe (forgettable)
- Mario Strikers Battle League Football (very mid)
- Mario & Sonic at the Olympic games (bad, do not recommend)
- Super Mario Bros. Wonder (pretty solid👍)
- Luigi's Mansion 3 (I played this game w my sister, it was very fun)
- Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (How to start a war with your family 2.0)
- Super Mario Party (How to start a war with your family 3.0)
- Mario Party Superstars (How to start a war with your family 4.0)
- Super Mario Sunshine (This gave me anger issues)
- Bowser's Fury (I liked it -when I was 10 °-°)
- Super Mario 3d World (Mario but if he was a furry)

> In conclusion I've played way too many Mario games :D

Aside from 10 million Mario games in different fonts I've also played:

- Stardew Valley (Kinda boring for my taste)
- Minecraft (Slay)
- Minecraft < Dungeons > (No, just no)
- Sonic Frontiers (overrated)
- Sonic Mania (Idk, solid I guess)
- Rayman Legends (When I was 6💀)
- Portal 2 (Good :D)
- Life is Strange (Good I guess)
- Ori and the Blind Forest (I liked it 🥰 + the visuals were really pretty)
- GTA 5 (Good for relaxing)
- Rocket League (mid)
- NFS Unbound (mid)
- Forza 3 (mid)
- Diablo III (Traumatized 6-7 year old me 💀)
- Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy (Bad, I didn't like this one)

Here are some assassin's Creed games I've played:

- Assassin's Creed - Origins (Good 👍)
- Assassin's Creed - Odyssey (Also good)
- Assassin's Creed - Unity (Good, the other two were better though)
- Assassin's Creed - Valhalla (Never finished it lol)

>Ngl I forgot 80% of the plot because 9 year old me was having more fun terrorrizing random innocent NPC's 🥲

I also had a Zelda phase, so there's that:
- TLoZ: BotW (Took up 50% of my brain storage for 2 entire years. Also I finished this game to 100% and beat the game at least 10 times so there's that 🥲 I also really love the visuals🥰)
- TLoZ: TotK (BotW is better, still really good game though 👍 Again the visuals were great 🥰)
- TLoZ: Link's Awakening (mid)
- TLoZ: The Windwaker (ummm no)
- Hyrule Warriors (mid, but good for ppl who's brains are infected by the Zelda brainrot)

> In conclusion, I really liked it, I was still planning on playing Skyward Sword, Majora's Mask, Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess, but then I kind of forgot. (SLAY)

Here are some of the games I've played recently:
- DDLC (Overrated, I expected more)
- Omori (Good, I expected it to be sadder though, also something about the art style is wrong, Idk what though)
- Roblox (My sister made me play DTI, Doors, the Mimic and MM2 and so on👹)
- Geometry Dash (Idk if this really counts, since it's a mobile game??? Anyways, I have a bet with my brother that he will give me 100 $ if I beat the last Level. I am well aware that he doesn't have that much, but I still want to prove him wrong hehe)

>Overall, I really like games with nice visuals, since I am an artist and I therefore value it a lot. On top of that, over the course of the last year, I've also really started to take a liking towards RPG games, since I like interesting stories and seeing different outcomes and endings to them.🥰
