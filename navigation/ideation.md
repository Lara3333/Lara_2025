Since I don't exactly know what I want my RPG to be about, I'll start off by listing thing I want to include:
- Plot/ Main Quest
- NPC's you can interact with, whether it is just having a nice talk, receiving a hint or getting power-up
- Decision making: since this is an RPG I'd like the player to be able to make different decisions that influence the ending of the game. I think it would probably be good about 2 decisions the player has to make (ex: Pick a or b, but 2 times), because that way the player is engaged in the game and there is a variety of possibilities for the different endings. On top of that I think maybe it would be easier to start off with a less complex story. (Of course, if this is too much work I could lower it down to 1 decision)
- I'd the game to be more gameplay oriented while still keeping a plot that the player has to follow. Like for example, puzzles, battles and mini games along the story.
- If there is extra time left, I'd like to include some funny secrets and mini side stories, since I believe it's a really fun to search for them (THIS IS JUST AN EXTRA; MEANING THAT IF THERE IS NO TIME LEFT, THIS PART WILL GET SKIPPED)

Here are some examples for the visuals (These are just examples, not what I want the game to specifically look like):
