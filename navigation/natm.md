## How I plan to change based offf of the Feedback I got

**Things I will continue doing:**
- Keep things organized and always plan out my work a couple of weeks ahead with burn down lists, as well as keeping a draw.io to keep my files organized. Not only have I witnessed the benefits of doing so myself, but additionally a lot of adults and professionals advised me to keep it up.

**Things I will change/improve**
- In the future I will try to present in a more structured way, because often when Avantika and I present we talk over one another, which is why next time we will plan out the presentation before we actually do it.
