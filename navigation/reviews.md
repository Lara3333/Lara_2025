Here are the reviews and feedback I've gotten.

*"Nice work presenting concepts and applying them to your project work. Keep learning!"*

*"Nice job showing your work and the different versions of the game.  Well done"*

*"I loved seeing the progression in each version of the game!"*

*"Your game was very nice, interesting progression, and clearly demonstrated knowledge of different methods, classes, objects, etc."*

*"I like your game. The different characters are nicely done. I like the progression of your RPG"*

*"I really liked the NPC that you added, and you seem to have a nice idea of adding dialog between all 4 characters. You can maybe improve understanding on variables, input, and output section. Game work, hack usage, was all on point and there wasn't anything missing from the checklist, just work on the variables, input, and output knowledge."*

### Conclusion

Based off the feedbacks, it seems like most people like seeing the progression of my game and projects, which is why, I will keep updating the RPG and continue to show my progressions. Another thing I will definetely keep doing is trying to connect the concepts I've learned throughout this class to my game and website, because it makes both explaining and listening easier.
